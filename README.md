# Agenda_Piece
 
Agenda Piece is a supplimentary game to play while watching me present the below slideshow about online anime powerscaling discourse. It does not function as a standalone project!
While I move through my slides, the "agendas" of each given character will move up or down over time, functioning as a sort of stock market for hype moments and aura.
